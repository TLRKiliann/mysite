# My portfolio

This is a brief introduction to me and my background so far in IT. I describe the different technologies and programming languages I use.

I thank `GitHub` for allowing me to host my portfolio for free.

And I also thank `FreeCodeCamp` and `OpenClassRoom` for allowing me to learn for free.

Enjoy it!
